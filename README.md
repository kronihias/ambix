ambiX Ambisonic plug-in suite
==========

> cross-platform Ambisonic VST, LV2 plug-ins with variable order for use in Digital Audio Workstations like Reaper or Ardour or as Jack standalone applications.
> The plug-in suite use the ambiX *(1)* convention (ACN channel order, SN3D normalization, full periphony (3D)) except the sqrt(1/4pi) factor in equation 3.
> these plug-ins use a recursive implementation of the spherical harmonics, therefore the maximum Ambisonic order is defined at compile time. the practical maximum order is rather defined by the hosts maximum channel count (N+1)^2 or your CPU power

* ambix_binaural - binaural decoder with various loudspeaker setups in real world studios/venues

* ambix_decoder - same as binaural decoder but without the convolution, the loudspeaker signals are sent directly to the outputs (single band decoding)
	* presets for ambix_binaural (including impulse responses) and ambix_decoder are located in the folder ambix_binaural/Presets (or available as separate download) and should be copied in following folders
		* Windows 7,8: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ambix\binaural_presets\
		* MacOS: ~/Library/ambix/binaural_presets/
		* Linux: ~/ambix/binaural_presets/

* ambix_converter - convert between different ambisonic standards on the fly (include different standards in one project), also between 2D/3D

* ambix_directional_loudness - amplify, attenuate or filter out certain parts of the spherical soundfielddf

* ambix_encoder - panning plug-in with different numbers of input channels - a width parameter spreads those channels equally along the azimuth

* ambix_maxre - apply or reciprocal apply spherical max_re weighting to suppress sidelobes according to Zotter, Frank - "All-Round Ambisonic Panning and Decoding"
 
* ambix_mirror - invert or mirror soundfield about x/y/z axis

* ambix_rotator_z - rotation around z axis

* ambix_rotator - rotation around xyz axis

* ambix_vmic - same principle as directional loudness but will not output ambisonics signal but the selected part of the soundfield - similar to the virtual microphone approach

* ambix_warp - warp soundfield towards equator, poles, front or back...* 

* ambix_widening - frequency dependant rotation around the z-axis, use this for source widening or creating diffuse early reflections, article: http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-12, Created with help of Franz Zotter and Matthias Frank



prerequisites for building
--------------

- cmake, working build environment
- Steinberg VST 2.4 SDK
- fftw3, Eigen 3
- Standalone applications: ASIO SDK if you want ASIO under Windows

Install LINUX dependencies (Debian, Ubuntu):
--------------
*$ sudo apt-get install libasound-dev libfreetype6-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libeigen3-dev freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libsoxr-dev libfftw3-dev libzita-convolver3 libzita-convolver-dev*

Fedora:
--------------
*$ sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel freetype-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXext-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel eigen3-devel freeglut-devel libXmu-devel libXi-devel soxr-devel fftw3-devel libXrandr-devel jack-audio-connection-kit-devel*

*$ sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"*

*$ sudo dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"*


Install MacOSX dependencies (through MacPorts):
--------------

*$ sudo port install eigen3-devel soxr*


Install Windows dependencies
--------------
*getting the dependencies for Windows is a little bit more tricky. you have to get fftw3, libsoxr and Eigen.*


howto build ambix yourself:
--------------

- copy the Steinberg VST 2.4 SDK into the folder *mcfx/vstsdk2.4* (due to legal reasons those can not be included here)

- use cmake gui or cmake/ccmake from terminal:

- adjusts the various parameters to your needs, make sure the libraries are found

**TERMINAL:**

- create a folder in the *ambix* folder eg. *BUILD*

*ambix/BUILD> $ ccmake ..*

- adjust parameters 

then
*ambix/BUILD> $ make*

*(if you have a multicore processor you can speed up the make process by using make -j #CPUCORESx1.5)*

- find the binaries in the *ambix/BUILD/_bin* folder and copy to system VST folder

**VST installation folders:**


- MacOSX: /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST or ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST
- Windows: eg. C:\Programm Files\Steinberg\VstPlugins
- Linux: /usr/lib/lxvst or /usr/local/lib/lxvst

LV2 plug-in
-----------

- compile the plug-ins with the flag BUILD_LV2 ON

- go to the folder *lv2-ttl-generator* and **> make** for compiling the tool *lv2_ttl_generator*

- go to the _bin folder (eg. *ambix/BUILD/_bin* ) and execute the script *> ./../../lv2-ttl-generator/generate-ttl.sh*
this will generate all needed .tll files, afterwards you can copy all .lv2 folders from *ambix/BUILD/_bin/lv2* to /usr/lib/lv2

known problems
-----------
* documentation missing - for now you can check this:

* GUI less plug-ins can not be used as standalone - therefore GUI for some more of the plug-ins would be nice...

* Linux: LV2 plug-ins don't show the GUI, VST plug-ins GUI might crash - better just stick to the hosts' GUI or help me fix that. you can use the standalone version in any case and connect via Jack

* different orders require different plug-in instances: maybe VST 3 can fix that with it's dynamic input/output ports. but we'll have to wait for it beeing implemented in appropriate hosts.
